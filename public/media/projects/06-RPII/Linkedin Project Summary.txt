Project "Saturn V" focused on the collaborative design and development of a medium-sized launcher system to capture growth in the launch market, utilizing project management techniques and rotating topics to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the design, followed by a division of responsibilities based on expertise. My contributions included conducting a market analysis to identify viable launch opportunities and designing the propulsion system architecture, where I developed the P&ID schematic for the propellant feed system and thrust chamber, emphasizing mass flow control and operational safety. I designed the bell nozzle using parabolic geometry to optimize performance and calculated the nozzle contour parameters with MATLAB, resulting in a detailed final design represented in OpenRocket. Our team's dedication and collaboration earned us the award for Best Team Spirit, significantly enhancing my knowledge of rocket propulsion systems and providing valuable experience in interdisciplinary teamwork and complex project development.
