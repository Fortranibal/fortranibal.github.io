As I contemplate how snow falls on the other side of the window, it makes me reminisce about my summer endeavors. 

Asteroid Mining Corporation Ltd offered me a summer internship focused on the innovative field of asteroid mining. I was allowed to take on a range of responsibilities that allowed me to make a meaningful contribution to the company and the industry.

Throughout the summer, I assessed the viability of mining a specific near-Earth asteroid using state-of-the-art terrestrial mining technologies and innovative concepts. It proved as a project equally exciting and challenging that allowed me to demonstrate my technical knowledge and creativity in a real-world setting. I was able to contribute to the foundation of knowledge that will shape the future of the company and the space industry, and I am proud to have played a significant part in the company's ongoing efforts to advance the field of asteroid mining.

One of my primary tasks was to develop market forecasts to locate future demand and unmet market opportunities. Extensive research and analysis had to be conducted, putting my problem-solving skills to the test. A diverse work environment, with a multinational team from many time zones, helped me develop my communication and collaboration skills. Together, we produced a scoping study that assembled everything we had researched and learned at the company. 

As a form of gratitude, I was honored to receive recognition for my hard work in the form of a meteorite rock! It was an enriching experience, and I feel grateful to have been a part of such a forward-thinking and dynamic organization.
