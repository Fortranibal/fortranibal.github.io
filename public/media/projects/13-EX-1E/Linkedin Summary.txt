Project WESP, undertaken by WARR Rocketry, participated in the Spaceport America Cup 2024 (SAC). As the world's largest Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition, SAC brings together over 1,700 students and faculty from 150+ institutions worldwide. In this prestigious event, our team joined 152 others, including 66 international teams, showcasing our dedication to pushing the boundaries of aerospace engineering. Competing in the 30k ft COTS All propulsion types category alongside 29 distinguished teams, Project WESP accomplished the 3rd position, becoming Europe's first student, staged rocket. The project embodies innovation and excellence in rocketry by presenting a staged rocket with a sideways recovery system that flies supersonic regimes.
