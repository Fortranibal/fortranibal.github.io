### Technical Project Description:
The Financial Market Simulator is a C++ application designed to mimic real-world stock market dynamics by integrating user-selected financial strategies and real S&P500 market data. This simulator operates in two main modules: User Portfolio and Market Simulation.

User Portfolio Module:
The portfolio builder empowers users to define initial capital and select predefined investment strategies aligned with varied risk profiles. Once users determine their strategy, they can allocate assets to individual stocks based on calculated coefficients that reflect distinct risk-return ratios. By allowing users to adjust these factors, the simulator provides a personalized approach to market engagement.

Market Simulation Module:
Leveraging Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), a stochastic model for predicting stock price movements, this module simulates stock value fluctuations over time. Using historical S&P500 data, it computes real-time price adjustments for each selected stock and outputs the resulting portfolio performance, including stock-wise and overall portfolio return. Users can simulate multiple investment timelines and observe the impact of various asset allocations on their returns.

Development Sprints:
The simulator followed a structured development roadmap:

Sprint 1: Core functionality to enable basic market simulations with user-defined portfolios.
Sprint 2 (planned): Enhancements to include advanced wallet management, expanding interactions between market fluctuations and wallet balances based on stock movements.
Sprint 3 (planned): Code optimization, targeting potential bottlenecks and improving performance using C++ Standard Library (STL) containers, vectorization, and algorithm complexity analysis.
