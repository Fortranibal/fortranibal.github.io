What is WSPR?
- WSPR is our in-house software to simulate 6 DOF trajectories for WESP. Managing over 8 active members  at any given time and an overall 14 developers, WSPR will recently be 1 year old. Our approach is to have rapid iterations of parallel developments. I hold weekly meetings were we present to each other our developments and provide feedback for improvements. 
- Initially, we considered creating a trajectory simulator which worked exclusively for solid propellant rockets because WESP only deals with solid motors. But as the project evolved and more developers joined the team, I decided to expand the capabilities of it beyond solid motors. 

Features:
- Dynamic Mass 6DOF Trajectory simulation
- Datcom Corrective Factors Inclusion
- Safety range analysis
- Automatic Report Generation
- Web App GUI
- Telemetry Data analysis
- AR Scenery

Over 1,200h of work I have poured onto this project
